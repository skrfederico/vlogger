# Vlogger (Video Logs App for General Assembly students) 

## Description 
 
A CRUD application that focuses on video logs for the GA SEIR Flex program. The app aims to assist users in reviewing class concepts and accelerate their search for specific topics and references.

## The end goal

To assist both myself and my classmates, I designed a CRUD app that streamlines the process of managing notes related to class content in the videos.

## Background info 

While studying at General Assembly, I frequently found myself revisiting class videos. However, it was often a challenge to locate specific points within the content's timeline, and I struggled to recall which videos contained overarching concepts.

## Features

- Index Page

  - The main page is an index page that renders all of the videologs (vlogs) organized in a chronological way.

- Vlog page

  Each video log entry lets you record the time of a particular mention or explanation of a concept. Additionally, the app provides a large text input that accommodates up to 12 lines per entry.
  
- Nav bar

  - A header navigation bar with links to General Assembly's (main) webpage, "Hedwig's Website" that takes you to our cohort web, a "New" option to create a new vlog and a search bar to help the user find specific 'vlogs' using keywords.
